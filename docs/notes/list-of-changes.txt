From 1.0 to 1.0.1.


- make_documentation.py

Changed way function code is printed, replacing < with &lt;



- fragments

Loading fragments now uses a list of contents of xml elements rather
than just one string. This makes it easier to strip existing tags.

- tarsqi.py

Added option remove_tags (default is True), which is used to remove
all tags inside the content tag. Updated component.py and the manual
accordingly.


- utilties.xml_utlis

When tag cannot be merged in, try to extend it to the left and/or
right. This reduces the number of missed TIMEX3 tags in Timebank from
81 to 20, with the remaining mostly due to chunking errors (eg
"<NG>British Prime Minister Tony Blair 10/CD days</NG> ago" in
APW19980322.0749.xml).
