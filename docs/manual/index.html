<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The Tarsqi Toolkit (also referred to as TTK or the Toolkit) is a set of
components for extracting temporal information from news wire texts. TTK
extracts time expressions, events, subordination links and temporal links; in
addition, it can ensure consistency of temporal information.</p>

<p>The first version of the toolkit, version 1.0, was released in 2007,
accompanied by many promises and threats that there would be a new version
soon... it took a decade. Version 2.0.0 differs from version 1.0 in many
respects: code was simplified and debugged, documentation was updated, the
Mallet toolkit was used, stand-off annotation was adopted, libraries were
redesigned, and test and evaluation code was added. However, version 2.0.0 does
not significantly change the toolkit's performance in terms of speed or
precision and recall.</p>

<a name="prereq"></a>

<h2>3. Requirements and Installation</h2>

<p>The toolkit runs on recent versions of Linux and Mac OSX (and should run on
Windows, but see below). The code requires Python version 2.7, Perl version 5.8
or newer and the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 (version 7 will probably
work as well). Java is needed for running the third party software used by the
toolkit.</p>

<p>Installation is a four step process:</p>

<ol>

  <li>
    <p>Install the toolkit code. This is simply a matter of unpacking the
    downloaded archive or cloning the TTK Git repository
    at <a href="https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk.git">https://github.com/tarsqi/ttk.git</a>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Install the Part-of-Speech Tagger. The Tarsqi toolkit is designed to work
      seamlessly with the IMS TreeTagger. Download the packages needed for your
      platform from
      the <a href="http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/">TreeTagger
      website</a> and follow the directions. You can install the TreeTagger
      wherever you like, but you will need to tell the Toolkit where it can find
      the tagger (see below). There is an example script
      <code>build/install-treetagger-osx.sh</code> which shows how to install
      the TreeTagger on Mac OSX. (Note: all file names printed in this manual
      are relative to the path where TTK is installed).
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Install MALLET. The classifiers in the Toolkit use the MAchine Learning
      for LanguagE Toolkit (McCallum, Andrew Kachites. "MALLET: A Machine
      Learning for Language Toolkit."
      <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu">http://mallet.cs.umass.edu</a>. 2002). Download
      version 2.0.8
      from <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php">http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php</a>. Version
      2.0.7 will most likely work as well. You can put MALLET wherever you want,
      but as with the TreeTagger you need to tell the Toolkit where to find
      it. There is an example script <code>build/install-mallet-osx.sh</code>
      which shows how to install MALLET on Mac OSX.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Create and edit the settings.txt file. The toolkit comes with an example
      file with settings in <code>code/settings.sample.txt</code>. Copy that
      file into code/settings.txt and edit it as needed. In most cases, the only
      settings you will need to change are the <code>treetagger</code>
      and <code>mallet</code> options, with the values depending on where you
      installed the TreeTagger and MALLET.</p>
  </li>

</ol>

<p>To test the toolit open a terminal and make sure your working directory is
in the <code>code</code> directory of the distribution, then type the
following:</p>

<pre class="example">
python tarsqi.py data/in/simple-xml/tiny.xml out.xml
</pre>

<p>If all is well you will now have a file named <code>out.xml</code> with the
  content below (but note that the value in the dct tag will be today's date and
  that tags will be on one line).</p>

<pre class="example">
&lt;ttk>
&lt;text>

Fido sleeps today.

&lt;/text>
&lt;metadata>
  &lt;dct value="20170113"/>
&lt;/metadata>
&lt;source_tags>
  &lt;text id="1" begin="1" end="21" />
&lt;/source_tags>
&lt;tarsqi_tags>
  &lt;docelement id="d1" begin="2" end="20" origin="DOCSTRUCTURE" type="paragraph" />
  &lt;s id="s1" begin="2" end="20" origin="PREPROCESSOR" />
  &lt;lex id="l1" begin="2" end="6" lemma="Fido" origin="PREPROCESSOR"
       pos="NNP" text="Fido" />
  &lt;ng id="c1" begin="2" end="6" origin="PREPROCESSOR" />
  &lt;lex id="l2" begin="7" end="13" lemma="sleep" origin="PREPROCESSOR"
       pos="VBZ" text="sleeps" />
  &lt;vg id="c2" begin="7" end="13" origin="PREPROCESSOR" />
  &lt;EVENT begin="7" end="13" aspect="NONE" class="OCCURRENCE" eid="e1" eiid="ei1"
         epos="VERB" form="sleeps" origin="EVITA" pos="VBZ" tense="PRESENT" />
  &lt;lex id="l3" begin="14" end="19" lemma="today" origin="PREPROCESSOR"
       pos="NN" text="today" />
  &lt;ng id="c3" begin="14" end="19" origin="PREPROCESSOR" />
  &lt;TIMEX3 begin="14" end="19" origin="GUTIME" tid="t1" type="DATE" value="20170113" />
  &lt;lex id="l4" begin="19" end="20" lemma="." origin="PREPROCESSOR" pos="." text="." />
  &lt;TLINK eventInstanceID="ei1" origin="BLINKER-Type-1a"
         relType="IS_INCLUDED" relatedToTime="t1" />
  &lt;TLINK origin="LINK_MERGER"
         relType="INCLUDES" relatedToEventInstance="ei1" timeID="t1" />
&lt;/tarsqi_tags>
&lt;/ttk>
</pre>

<p>A note for Windows users. TTK 1.0 depended on some software that did not run
on Windows. The current version does not have that problem and the code should
run on Windows. However, this has not been tested properly yet and the above
instructions may not be entirely correct for Windows (for example, it may be the
case that MALLET has to be installed in the top level directory of the c:
drive).</p>

<h2>4. Using the TARSQI Toolkit</h2>

<p>To run the TARSQI Toolkit, open a terminal and change the working directory
to the <code>code</code> directory of the distribution. You can run Tarsqi on a
file or a directory and the general format of the command is as follows:</p>

<pre class="example">
python tarsqi.py [OPTIONS] INFILE OUTFILE
python tarsqi.py [OPTIONS] INDIR OUTDIR
</pre>

<p>In the first invocation INFILE needs to exist but OUTFILE should not
exist. In the second invocation INDIR has to be a directory and OUTDIR either
should not exist, in which case it is created, or it should be a directory. In
the latter case you will be asked to confirm whether it is okay to overwrite
files in OUTDIR, if not, the program will exit. All files in INDIR will be
processed except for hidden files (starting with '.' and files ending in '~').</p>

<p>There are several options you can use, none of them are mandatory. Options
can be set in the options file (<code>code/settings.txt</code>) or overruled on
the command line. For a full list see the settings file and the module
documentation string in <code>code/tarsqi</code> (which can also be browsed
at <a href="../code/modules/tarsqi.html">docs/code/modules/tarsqi.html</a>). Here
we will just present the two options you are most likely to use.</p>

<p><code>--source (xml|text|ttk|...)</code></p>

<blockquote>
An input type that should be used for default XML. It assumes that a
document contains a tag named TEXT that wraps the data that need to be
parsed and that the data have not yet been processed in any way. The
value of the tag that wraps the data can be overridden using the
content_tag flag (see below). This input type can be used for the
files in <code>code/data/in/simple-xml</code>.
</blockquote>

<!--
<code>timebank</code>
<blockquote>
This input type is very similar to <code>simple-xml</code>, the main
difference is that it activates a component that parses document
creation times for the various TimeBank formats. This input type can
be used for the files in <code>code/data/in/TimeBank</code>, which
consists of all TimeBank files with all tags (except some document
level tags) stripped out.  
</blockquote>

<code>rte3</code>
<blockquote>
Use this input type when processing pre-processed data from
<code>code/data/in/RTE3</code>, which contains data from the <a
href="http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE3/">Third Pascal
Textual Entailment Challenge</a>. 
</blockquote>
-->

<p><code>--pipeline String</code></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Can be used to overrule the default pipeline specified
in <code>code/settings.txt</code>. A pipeline is a comma-separated string of
component names. Allowed component names are <code>PREPROCESSOR, TOKENIZER,
TAGGER, CHUNKER, GUTIME, EVITA, SLINKET, S2T, BLINKER, CLASSIFIER</code> and
<code>LINK_MERGER</code>. The order of the components in the pipeline
specification is significant. Some examples are:</p>

<p class="example">
--pipeline PREPROCESSOR,GUTIME,EVITA<br>
--pipeline TOKENIZER,TAGGER,CHUNKER,GUTIME,EVITA<br>
--pipeline SLINKET,S2T,BLINKER,CLASSIFIER,LINK_MERGER
</p>

<p>The first example instructs TTK to take a file, preprocess it and add time
expressions and events. The second example is identical except that individual
preprocessing modules are used instead of the PREPROCESSOR shorthand. For the
third example, preprocessing, times and events are taken for granted and only
links are added. In this case the input needs to be a ttk file which has the
needed information.</p>

<h2>5. Documentation</h2>

<p>There is more documentation apart from the installation notes and minimal
manual in this document. All documentation is in the <code>docs</code>
directory. Some of it is quite useful, but some documents are there merely for
historical reference. Here is a short description for each subdirectory
in <code>docs</code>:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1">

<tr valign=top>
<td>docs/code</td>
<td>The documentation of the Python code can be browsed
at <a href="../code/index.html">docs/code/index.html</a>, which has a list of
links to all modules. For each module the documentation strings for classes and
functions are printed. Documentation of the code is uneven: some modules are
well-documented, other have spotty and underwhelming documentation or are not
documented at all. The pages are generated with the
<code>code/utilities/make_documentation.py</code> script, which was created
because the <code>pydoc</code> command used to crash on many of the toolkit
modules.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td>docs/design</td>
<td>Notes on the design of the toolkit including the algorithms used in many
components are
in <a href="../design/index.html">docs/design/index.html</a>. Quite unfinished. There is a list of tags generated in <a href="../design/1-toplevel.html#tags">docs/design/1-toplevel.html#tags</a>.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td>docs/manual</td>
<td>Contains the document you are reading now.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td>docs/notes</td>
<td>Various notes, mostly out of date.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td>docs/papers</td>
<td>Toolkit publications.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td>docs/specifications</td>
<td>Contains a document written a decade ago, for historical interest only.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td>docs/tracking</td>
<td>Some old bugs and feature requests that will be folded into the GitHub site
or else be discarded.</td>
</tr>

<h2>7. Known Issues</h2>

<li>Bad CPU type in executable

<p>This error may be thrown by the bin/tree-tagger executable in the treetagger
directory. You have the wrong executable. Install the correct version for your
operating system.</p>

<li>TreeTagger parameter file invalid: english.par

<p>This is thrown by components.preprocessing.treetaggerwrapper.TreeTaggerError
and it can occur when your versions of the treetagger and the treetaggerwrapper
script are out of sync. Find the line

<blockquote>
"tagparfile": "english.par",
</blockquote>

and replace it with

<blockquote>
"tagparfile": "english-utf8.par",
</blockquote>

Note that this should really be fixed by using the new treetaggerwrapper.</p>
