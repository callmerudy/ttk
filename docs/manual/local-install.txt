Getting a working copy of the Tarsqi Toolkit
--------------------------------------------

Marc Verhagen, November 2007

Please let me know if these directions do not work for you


--------------


To get a working copy of the toolkit do the following:


1. Get the toolkit code

Make sure you have the CVSROOT variable set correctly by adding the
following line to your ~/.cshrc file:

	setenv CVSROOT /home/j/corpuswork/cvs-root

We have had problems with the bash shell before, I'm using the csh for
CVS.

Now checkout ttk in a directory of your choice:

	% cvs checkout ttk

This gives you all our code as well as documentation.

The manual is in:

	ttk/docs/manual/index.html


2. Get the TreeTagger

You could follow the directions in the manual. Easier is to cd to a
directory I created:

	% cd /home/j/marc/timeml/tarsqi/code/TTK/resources

And then type

	% ./install.sh <ttk-directory> tagger linux|osx 

For example

	% ./install.sh ~llc/tools/ttk tagger linux

This will install a linux version of the treetagger in

	~llc/tools/ttk/code/preprocessing/treetagger


3. Get Tango

(only if you want to use the gui and view the graphs)

Use the same installer script as above:

	% ./install.sh <ttk-directory> tango

For example:

	% ./install.sh ~llc/tools/ttk/ tango

This will install tango in

	~llc/tools/ttk/code/demo/tango-v15



4. Run setup and test the installation

Simply cd to the code directory and run the setup script

	% cd ttk/code
	% python setup.py

(Note that this is different from what is said in the manual, some
changes made since the 1.0 release have not yet found there way to the
manual).

Test it by 

	% python tarsqi simple-xml data/in/simple-xml/test.xml out.xml
