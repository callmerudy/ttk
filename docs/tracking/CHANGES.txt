SHOULD CHANGE

- loading documents into the ATEE parser that already have event tags etc fails
  (replicate this by replacing the input ATEE XML file with a processed file)

- tokenizer should protect some strings as one token
  xml tags, urls etc

- installation of treetagger (osx and linux and windows versions?)

- all file and directory code should be platfrom independent
