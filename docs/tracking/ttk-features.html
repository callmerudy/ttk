<li class="header">Code to add DCT does not work</li>

<blockquote>

Reported: 10/27/07<br>
Status: mostly fixed<br><br>

This occurs accros the board. At the least, the default should be to get the current date. <br><br>

10/30/07: this is now mostly fixed:
<ul>
<li>The DCT is extracted for TimeBank and the ATEE data. For rte3 it
uses the default, which is to set the DCT to the current date. For
user input (which should use the simple-xml document type) the dct is
also set to the current date.
<li>The DCT is handed to GUTime, which uses it to compute the value of
timexes like today, tomorrow and this week. I have seen cases where
today is correctly resolved to the current data ("he looked at the
procession today") as well as cases where today is resolved to
PRESENT_REF ("he looked at the game today"). In the latter case there
is a temporal function.
<li>The DCT is also handed over to Blinker, but the Blinker rules that
link events to the DCT are not yet implemented.
</ul>

11/01/07: 
<ul>
<li>But note that at some point we need to get the DCT into the
picture again. It now lives as a variable in the document model and
not in the text itself. So what is displayed in the views does not
have the DCT, not does it enter in the Tango TBox because the DCT is
never tagged with a TIMEX3 tag.
</ul>

<li class="header"> John leaves today</li>

<blockquote>

Reported: 10/29/07<br>
Status: fixed<br><br>

This now gets a link BEFORE(leaves, today). This relation comes from
the classifier, it should be overwritten by a relation from
Blinker. Note that "John looked at the game today" does work.<br><br>

10/30/07:
<ul>
<li>Blinker now has a rule that fires for the pattern "[VERBCHUNK]
[CHUNK-WITH_TIMEX]" where the chunk with timex cannot include an EVENT
(in which case it the timex would be linked to the event in the same
chunk, cf "John leaves the 1997 war")> This also works for "John
leaves the house today".
<li>The rule is smart enough to know that it should not create a link
for "John does not leave today"
</ul>

<br>

10/31/07:
<ul>
<li>The rule was intentionally made more stupid, it does create a link
for "John does not leave today". See explanation immediately below.
</ul>

<li class="header">John does not leave today</li>

<blockquote>

Reported: 10/29/07<br>
Status: fixed<br><br>

Gets the relation INCLUDES(leave, today). A fix for the previous bug
should be sophisticated enough to not assign INCLUDES(today, leave),
but this can only be done by assigning the negation of a reltype,
which we cannot do.<br><br>

10/31/07:
<ul>
<li>It is okay to have an INCLUDES relation here, the idea being that
there is an INCLUDES relation but that it is coloured by a negative
polarity, similar to the way some tlinks are coloured by
intentionality.
</ul>


</blockquote>



<li class="header">Timexes are not linked</li>

<blockquote>

Reported: 10/30/07<br>
Status: fixed<br><br>

The simple ordering rules for timexes have not yet been added to the toolkit.<br><br>

10/30/07:<br>
<ul>
<li>Timex linking added to Blinker, but threw away all the IDENTITY
results from the code, replacing it with a simple string match
<li>Documents with many timexes will now be much more connected
</ul>
