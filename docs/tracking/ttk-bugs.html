<li class="header">Conversion error on TimeBank-1-pre/ABC19980108.1830.0711</li>

<blockquote>

Reported: 10/29/07<br>
Status: fixed for this document<br><br>

When processing TimeBank-1-pre/ABC19980108.1830.0711, with document
type timebank-preprocessed, the code that converts into the shallow
tree throws an error. This error does not occur with
TimeBank/ABC19980108.1830.0711.xml, it also does not occur with
TimeBank-1-pre/ABC19980114.1830.0611<br><br>

10/30/07:<br>
<ul>
<li>This was caused by an error in Evita, which takes a token "owns"
and marks up the 's' as an event. There may to be some interplay with
the VX tags or some of the other tags that go beyond the minimum set
of NG and VG.
<li>The document was replaced by one created with the toolkit
preprocessor. But other documents with extra tags remain in the
directory. Many of them seem to work, but the error was not truly
fixed so other documents could croak.
</ul>

<li class="header">Preprocessor error on TimeBank/AP900815-0044.xml</li>

<blockquote>

Reported: 10/30/07<br>
Status: fixed for this document<br><br>

Seems like an exception in the unpacking code of the converter. This
error does not occur on the other AP document.<br><br>

10/30/07:
<ul>
<li>This was caused by stray XML tags in the document. The tokenizer
leaves them glued on, the tagger creates items like
"&lt;IN-MW>according/VBG to/TO &lt;/IN-MW>diplomatic/JJ" and the
chunker introduces crossing tags:
"&lt;VG>&lt;IN-MW>according/VBG&lt;/VG> to/TO
&lt;/IN-MW>diplomatic/JJ". The formatConversor chokes on these.
<li>This was fixed for this document by removing the offending tags
when first creating the fragment.
<li>Needs a more robust solution
</ul>

<li class="header">No event in "He'll sleep"</li>

<blockquote>

Reported: 10/30/07<br>
Status: not fixed<br><br>

This is a problem with the tagger, which tags 'll' and 'sleep' as
nouns. All is fine with "He will sleep". What also works is "He'll
vindicate us".

<li class="header">ATEE document break in an early processing phase</li>

<blockquote>

Reported: 10/30/07<br>
Status: fixed for these documents<br><br>

This is similar to the problem with TimeBank/AP900815-0044.xml:
unexpected XML tags do not mesh with the preprocessing
modules. <br><br>

10/30/07:<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed by filtering out the Para tags
<li>Need a better solution
</ul>
